<h1>The Best Movies According to Elif </h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>LA HAINE</h3>
<p>This is a movie that criticises the France for being racist and the class and community distinction France was making in that time.  </p>
<h3>HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE</h3>
<p>This movie looks a like a movie for children but when you watch it you can clearly understand the message the movie wants to give viewers. Love has no conditions. </p>
<h3>OPPENHEIMER</h3>
<p>It was an amazing movie that teaches history and a little bit science together with the help of the great adventurous storyline.</p>
